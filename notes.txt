Creating a new game:
1. Insert a game type into the game_types table.

2. Create a dir in public/js/game_components for the new game type

3. In that dir, create index.js This must export a method which will render the game to 
    into the element div#game_board. Once the render is complete and the game has been 
    advanced, plug into any events needed to run the game
    Ex: document.querySelector( 'button#move' ).addEventListener( 'click', onMoveClick );

4. When a move is made in the game, a packet is sent to the server via WebSocket. 
    Ex:
        let packet = generateWSPacket( { action: 'move', game_id: game.id } );
        ws.send( packet );

5. Create a <game_type>.js file in /game_action_maps.  This must export an object
    containing named methods
    Ex:
        module.exports = {
            'move': async ( user_id, game ) => {}
        }

6. Add the new game type to the gameTypeMap in /wss_router.js
    Ex: <game_type_id>: <action_map>


7. Insert a row into the collective_queue table so that the UI will show it
